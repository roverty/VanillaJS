## JS Syballus

This section is intended to learn the key concepts about JS usage, language considerations and of course, the basic syntax of the language, such as, variables, constants, control statements, arrays and more. However, we do not stop deeply into the basics of the syntax, since almost every languages have the same mechanisms to code (and we assume you get the basics of them).

Here, you are provided with some links, that are essential to know for learning more and more information.

Some of this links have more resources inside them, so, feel free to explore them and try videos (if it suits you better) about the topics that you are reading.
